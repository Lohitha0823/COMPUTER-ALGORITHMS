3. Description

This project implements the Huffman Coding algorithm in Python, which is used for data compression by assigning variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies. The program accepts user input for characters and their frequencies and generates a prefix-free Huffman code for each character.

4. Getting Started

Dependencies:

Python 3.x
heapq module (built-in)
Operating System: Works on any system with Python 3.x installed (e.g., Windows 10, macOS, Linux)

Step-by-step instructions to implement program:

Enter the number of character-frequency pairs when prompted.
Provide each character and its frequency as input.
The program will display the Huffman codes for each character in the console.
